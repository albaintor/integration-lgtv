# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Found a bug, typo, missing feature or a description that doesn't make sense or needs clarification?
Great, please let us know!

### Bug Reports :bug:

If you find a bug, please search for it first in the [Issues of this repository](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-denonavr/issues),
and also in our common [feature and bugtracker repository for Remote Two](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/feature-and-bug-tracker/issues).
If it isn't already tracked, [create a new issue](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-denonavr/issues/new).

### New Features :bulb:

If you'd like to see or add new functionality to the library, describe the problem you want to solve in a
[new Issue](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-denonavr/issues/new).

### Pull Requests

**Any pull request needs to be reviewed and approved by the Unfolded Circle development team.**

We love contributions from everyone.

⚠️ If you plan to make substantial changes, we kindly ask you, that you please reach out to us first.  
Either by opening a feature request describing your proposed changes before submitting code, or by contacting us on
one of the other [feedback channels](#feedback-speech_balloon).

Since this software is being used on the embedded Remote Two device, we have to make sure it remains
compatible with the embedded runtime environment and runs smoothly.

Submitting pull requests for typos, formatting issues etc. are happily accepted and usually approved relatively quick.  

With that out of the way, here's the process of creating a pull request and making sure it passes the automated tests:

### Contributing Code :bulb:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Make your changes or enhancements (preferably on a feature-branch).

   Contributed code must be licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/),
   or a compatible license, if existing parts of other projects are reused (e.g. MIT licensed code).  
   It is required to add a boilerplate copyright notice to the top of each file:

    ```
    """
    {fileheader}
   
    :copyright: (c) {year} {person OR org} <{email}>
    :license: MPL-2.0, see LICENSE for more details.
    """
    ```

3. Make sure your changes follow the project's code style and the lints pass described in [Code Style](docs/code_guidelines.md).

4. Push to your fork.

5. Submit a pull request.

At this point we will review the PR and give constructive feedback.  
This is a time for discussion and improvements, and making the necessary changes will be required before we can
merge the contribution.
