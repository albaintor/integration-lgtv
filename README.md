# Sony AVR integration for Remote Two

Using [python-songpal](https://github.com/rytilahti/python-songpal)
and [uc-integration-api](https://github.com/aitatoi/integration-python-library)

The driver discovers Sony AVRs on the network. A media player entity is exposed to the core.

Supported attributes:

- State (on, off, playing, paused, unknown)
- Title
- Album
- Artist
- Artwork
- Source

Supported commands:

- Turn on
- Turn off
- Next
- Previous
- Volume up
- Volume down
- Pause (unfortunately resume to play is not supported by the library...)
- Source select

## Usage

### Setup

- Requires Python 3.11
- Install required libraries:  
  (using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is highly recommended)

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For running a separate integration driver on your network for Remote Two, the configuration in file
[driver.json](driver.json) needs to be changed:

- Set `driver_id` to a unique value, `uc_sony_driver` is already used for the embedded driver in the firmware.
- Change `name` to easily identify the driver for discovery & setup with Remote Two or the web-configurator.
- Optionally add a `"port": 8090` field for the WebSocket server listening port.
    - Default port: `9090`
    - Also overrideable with environment variable `UC_INTEGRATION_HTTP_PORT`

### Run

```shell
python3 intg-sonyavr/driver.py
```

See
available [environment variables](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-python-library#environment-variables)
in the Python integration library to control certain runtime features like listening interface and configuration
directory.

## Build self-contained binary for Remote Two

After some tests, turns out python stuff on embedded is a nightmare. So we're better off creating a single binary file
that has everything in it.

To do that, we need to compile it on the target architecture as `pyinstaller` does not support cross compilation.

### x86-64 Linux

On x86-64 Linux we need Qemu to emulate the aarch64 target platform:

```bash
sudo apt install qemu binfmt-support qemu-user-static
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
```

Run pyinstaller:

```shell
docker run --rm --name builder \
    --platform=aarch64 \
    --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v "$PWD":/workspace \
    docker.io/unfoldedcircle/r2-pyinstaller:3.11.6  \
    bash -c \
      "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt && \
      pyinstaller --clean --onefile --name intg-sonyavr intg-sonyavr/driver.py"
```

### aarch64 Linux / Mac

On an aarch64 host platform, the build image can be run directly (and much faster):

```shell
docker run --rm --name builder \
    --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v "$PWD":/workspace \
    docker.io/unfoldedcircle/r2-pyinstaller:3.11.6  \
    bash -c \
      "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt && \
      pyinstaller --clean --onefile --name intg-sonyavr intg-sonyavr/driver.py"
```
